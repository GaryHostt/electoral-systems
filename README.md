## ✨ Features

### 6 Core Electoral Systems Supported

#### Plurality Systems
- **First-Past-the-Post (FPTP)** - Simple plurality voting  
  *Individual race simulation: Single-seat system where each district elects one member*

#### Ranked-Choice Systems
- **Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV/RCV)** - Ranked elimination with transfers  
  *Individual race simulation: Single-winner election using ranked choices to simulate runoffs*
- **Single Transferable Vote (STV)** - Multi-winner proportional  
  *Legislative simulation: Fundamentally proportional and multi-winner, requires multiple seats to demonstrate vote transfers*

#### Proportional Systems
- **Party-List PR** - Proportional seat allocation by party  
  *Legislative simulation: Allocates seats proportionally using divisor methods at national/regional level*
  *Supports both Closed List (party-controlled) and Open List (voter influence on candidates)*

#### Mixed Systems
- **Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP)** - Compensatory proportionality  
  *Both simulation types: Combines district races (FPTP) with proportional top-up layer for overall proportionality*
- **Parallel Voting (MMM)** - Independent tiers  
  *Both simulation types: District races plus separate proportional list without compensatory adjustment*

### 🗺️ System Roadmap

#### Deprecated Systems (v2.3)
For simplicity and focus, the following systems have been removed:
- **Two-Round System (TRS)** - *Recommended alternative: Use IRV instead, which achieves similar majority-seeking goals through ranked-choice elimination*
- **Block Voting** - *May be re-implemented in future versions*
- **Limited Voting** - *May be re-implemented in future versions*
- **Approval Voting** - *May be re-implemented in future versions*

#### Future Roadmap
Systems planned for future implementation:
- **Borda Count** - Positional voting system (n-1, n-2, ..., 0 points)
- **Condorcet Method** - Pairwise comparison winner
